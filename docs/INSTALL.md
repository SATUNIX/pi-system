# Installation

pi-system is one pi package. A **profile** chooses which of its extensions, skills and prompts
load; there are no separate packages per profile. It is delivered from its public git repository,
`github.com/SATUNIX/pi-system` (set in `packages/core/distribution.json`). This is a beta; see
[Beta status](beta.md).

## Requirements

- Node.js 22.19 or newer and npm (pi's own requirement)
- git
- pi 0.85.1 or newer (`npm install -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`)

## The one install path

```sh
npm install -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
pi install git:github.com/SATUNIX/pi-system@v0.2.4-beta.0
pi
```

pi clones the release into `~/.pi/agent/git/github.com/SATUNIX/pi-system`. On the first
interactive start the kit applies the `balanced` profile and asks for a `/reload`. Set
`PI_KIT_AUTO_PROFILE=<name>` to pick another profile, or `0` to leave the package unfiltered.

The repository is public, so no credentials are involved. pi runs `npm install --omit=dev` in
its copy of the kit, as it does for every git package; the kit has no runtime dependencies of
its own, so that step fetches nothing from the npm registry.

## The scripted installer

Use the installer when you want a specific profile chosen up front, a non-interactive install, or
project scope. It wraps `pi install` and pi's settings, and is idempotent:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SATUNIX/pi-system.git
cd pi-system
node packages/core/install.mjs --channel latest --profile balanced
```

Run it from the clone root: the installer path is relative to the current directory.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--profile <name>` | One of the profiles in [Profiles](profiles.md). |
| `--channel latest\|next\|X.Y.Z` | Which release line to register (below). Implies git delivery. |
| `--git-ref <ref>` | Register an arbitrary branch, tag or commit (git delivery only). |
| `--mode local\|git\|npm` | `local` registers this checkout in place; `git` and `npm` register a released kit. |
| `--scope global\|project` | Global settings (default) or `.pi/settings.json` in the current repository. |
| `--only a,b` / `--all` | Specific extensions only, or everything. |
| `--yes` | Do not ask for confirmation. |
| `--dry-run` | Print what would change; change nothing. |
| `--no-externals` | Skip companion packages such as `pi-lens`. |
| `--uninstall` | Remove the kit and the companions this installer registered. |

The installer keeps **exactly one** registered copy of the kit: registering a checkout replaces
a release install and the other way round, because two copies would load every extension twice.

## Channels

| Channel | Install | Gets |
|---|---|---|
| `latest` (default) | `node packages/core/install.mjs --channel latest --profile balanced` | The newest release tag (betas count until the first stable release exists) |
| `next` | `node packages/core/install.mjs --channel next --profile balanced` | Every commit on `main` |
| pinned | `node packages/core/install.mjs --channel 0.2.4-beta.0 --profile balanced` | Exactly that release (tag `v0.2.4-beta.0`) |

`latest` needs at least one `vX.Y.Z` tag on the repository. Until the first release is tagged the
installer stops with a message saying there are no release tags and suggests `--channel next`;
it never guesses. `/update channel <name>` switches later. See [Updates](updates.md#channels).

## Profiles

Exact per-profile extension lists and counts are generated in the
[capability matrix](capability-matrix.md) (do not hand-count them; they drift). Requirements:

| Profile | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| `quick`, `balanced`, `long-horizon`, `lite` | Node, git, pi |
| `autonomous` | Node, git, pi. Unattended runs additionally need a container engine ([Autonomous runs](autonomy.md)) |
| `pentest` | Node, git, pi. Container deployment: `packages/container/README.md` |
| `self-improving` | Node, git, pi, Docker for memory services, optionally a second model (experimental) |

```sh
node packages/core/install.mjs --channel latest --profile lite            # small local models
node packages/core/install.mjs --channel latest --profile balanced --scope project
```

Inside pi, `/profile` switches profile in place and verifies the result. See [Profiles](profiles.md).

## Install modes

| Mode | Command | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Release from pi | `pi install git:github.com/SATUNIX/pi-system@vX.Y.Z` | Normal use; the profile is applied on first start |
| Release from the installer | `node packages/core/install.mjs --channel <latest\|next\|X.Y.Z> --profile <name>` | You want the profile chosen up front or a scripted install |
| Local checkout (editable) | `node packages/core/install.mjs --profile <name> --yes` | Developing the kit: pi loads the checkout in place, edit and `/reload` |
| Project auto-install | Ship `.pi/settings.json` in a repository | pi auto-installs on first trusted start |
| npm (not published yet) | `npx @satunix/pi-system --profile <name>` | Only once npm delivery is switched on ([Releasing](releasing.md#npm-publication-optional)) |

### From a checkout

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SATUNIX/pi-system.git && cd pi-system
npm ci --ignore-scripts
node packages/core/install.mjs --profile balanced --yes

# Specific extensions only
node packages/core/install.mjs --only secret-guard,memory-local,verify-gate --yes
```

## Coming from the private GitLab source

Installs made from the earlier private GitLab source are migrated automatically and safely; see
[Migration](migration.md).

## After install

1. Run `pi`.
2. `/reload` applies extension changes without restarting.
3. `pi list` shows the registered packages; `/kit` and `/footer status` show what is active.

## Web console

The optional web console is covered in [Web console](web-console.md): it is token-authenticated
and bound to loopback by default.

## Uninstall

```sh
# Removes the kit and the companions the installer registered (from the clone root):
node packages/core/install.mjs --uninstall
```

The command auto-detects the install state marker: a project marker at
`<current dir>/.pi/.pi-kit.json` wins if it exists, otherwise the global marker at
`~/.pi/agent/.pi-kit.json` is used. Pass `--scope project` or `--scope global` to force one. After
a project-scope install, run it from the repository root so the project marker is found and
`pi remove ... -l` runs with the matching scope. A project uninstall deletes only the project
marker; the global marker is left untouched.

The same precedence is used by the runtime readers that resolve install state (`/update`,
`/profile`, `/console`).

## Memory backends (`self-improving` profile — experimental)

The kit ships a Qdrant vector store for the memory MCP backend:

```sh
# Start the Qdrant vector store (memory-mcp backend)
docker compose -f packages/container/mcp-servers/memory-mcp/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

`memory-mem0` (an **experimental** extension in the `self-improving` profile) additionally
needs an external mem0 REST server, which this repo does not ship. Point it at your own mem0
instance:

```sh
# Set env var (add to ~/.pi/agent/.env) — only if you run your own mem0 server
MEM0_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```
