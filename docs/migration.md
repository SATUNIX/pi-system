# Migration

## From the private GitLab source

Before the public beta the kit was delivered from a private GitLab project
(`gitlab.home.internal/lab/pi-system`, and before that `gitlab.home.internal/root/pi-system`).
Those are **retired sources**. They are listed in `packages/core/distribution.json` under
`git.legacySources`, and an install still registered from one is migrated to
`github.com/SATUNIX/pi-system`.

### What happens

`/update` recognises a retired registration and:

- **never contacts the retired host**: it does not run `git ls-remote` against it, so a machine
  outside that network does not hang or report a false "up to date";
- reports the situation (`pi-system is registered from a retired private source ... /update kit
  moves it`) and, once you confirm, **moves the install to the public repository**;
- keeps the **channel** it was on (`next` stays `next`; a release or a pin becomes `latest`,
  because a private tag does not exist publicly);
- keeps your **profile** and saves any **hand edits** you made to the kit's settings entry
  (extensions or skills added or removed) into `<agent dir>/pi-kit/overrides.json` first, so they
  are applied again after the move. Nothing you customised is overwritten;
- removes the retired registration once the public one is in place, so the kit is not loaded
  twice, and **verifies** the result: if the install is still registered from the retired source
  afterwards, the update is reported as failed rather than done.

A `PI_SYSTEM_GIT_SOURCE` that still names a retired source (the earlier SSH instructions told you to
export one) is **ignored with a warning**. Unset it. To use SSH with the public repository, set
`PI_SYSTEM_GIT_SOURCE=git:git@github.com:SATUNIX/pi-system`.

The installer does the same thing when you run it from the retired copy pi kept:

```sh
node ~/.pi/agent/git/gitlab.home.internal/lab/pi-system/packages/core/install.mjs --profile <your profile> --yes --settings-only
```

It registers the public source and never reconnects to the private remote.

### Before the first public release is tagged

`latest` resolves to the newest `vX.Y.Z` tag on the public repository. Until the first tag exists
there is nothing for `latest` to resolve to, and the installer stops with a message saying so
instead of guessing. Migrate onto `main` in the meantime:

```sh
pi install git:github.com/SATUNIX/pi-system                    # channel next
node ~/.pi/agent/git/github.com/SATUNIX/pi-system/packages/core/install.mjs --profile <your profile> --yes --settings-only
```

Then `/update channel latest` once a release exists.

### If something is left behind

After a manual `pi install`, two copies of the kit can be registered until the installer runs; the
installer removes every kit registration except the one it is registering. `pi list` shows what is
registered. `/update status` shows the source and channel the kit follows.

## Breaking changes in 0.2.4-beta.0

- **Source**: the kit installs from `github.com/SATUNIX/pi-system`. Scripts that hard-coded the
  private GitLab URL need updating.
- **Node and pi**: Node.js 22.19 or newer and pi 0.85.1 or newer (the peer range moved from
  `>=0.76.0`). Older pi versions are not tested.
- **Approvals are scoped**: a remembered "allow" now applies to the exact action in the workspace,
  directory and session where you gave it, and expires. Approvals learned in one repository no
  longer run unasked in another, so some commands you had stopped being asked about will ask
  again. See [Security](security.md#approvals).
- **Approval cards time out**: an unanswered card is refused as uncertain after 15 minutes
  (`PI_KIT_FIREWALL_PROMPT_TIMEOUT_MS`) instead of waiting forever.
- **Web console needs a token**: `/console` prints a URL containing a one-time token, and requests
  without it are refused. See [Web console](web-console.md).
- **Optional companions changed**: `pi-lean-ctx` is no longer in any profile (it is opt-in, see
  [Supply chain](supply-chain.md)), and `pi-impact-analyzer` and the unused `pi-subagents`
  reference were removed. `pi-lens` and `pi-readseek` are unchanged.
- **Removed**: the `roles/` contracts and `packages/role-runner` (they targeted a private
  platform), the GitLab pipeline and release script, and historical design and review documents.
  Git history keeps them.
- **Footer**: `/footer` now has `light`, `default` and `heavy` layouts. `/footer <anything else>`
  is rejected instead of toggling the bar.
- **Profile switching is transactional**, and an unsafe firewall configuration (an unknown mode or
  policy, an unparseable `firewall.json`, an override that removes a mandatory protection) now
  fails before anything is written instead of being silently replaced.

See `CHANGELOG.md` in the repository root for the complete list.
