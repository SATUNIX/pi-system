# Future work and known limitations

Open items, each stated as a limitation that exists today, with what would close it. Nothing here
is a commitment or a schedule; see [Roadmap](roadmap.md) for direction and [Beta status](beta.md)
for what the beta does and does not cover. An item is removed when the code and a test close it,
not when it is written up.

Where an item implies a behaviour change in a safety mechanism (approvals, compaction,
delegation), the change is reviewed as a change to that mechanism, not as a bug fix.

## Verification that was not possible for this release

These are gaps in *evidence*, not known bugs. Each names the person or environment that can close
it.

| Not verified | Why | Who can close it |
|---|---|---|
| Behaviour against real model providers: the effort prompts, the auto-mode judge's verdicts, the completion reviewer, delegation quality | The release was prepared without provider credentials; every suite uses deterministic fakes or the real pi runtime without a model | An operator with a provider, running a representative task at each effort tier |
| The autonomous runner on rootless Podman, on macOS and Windows, and in a run of hours or days | `smoke:autonomy-container` ran on Docker only, in a disposable sandbox; the in-container boundary probe (`packages/autonomy/tests/boundary-probe.mjs`) is manual-only | An operator, per [Autonomous runs](autonomy.md) |
| A full autonomous run against a real model provider | The relay talks to a local fake upstream in every test | An operator with a provider key and a small budget |
| The web console's Content-Security-Policy in a browser | No browser was used | Anyone with a browser: open the console and check the progress bars render |
| The full check suite on Windows and on Node 24 | CI runs the suite on Linux with Node 22; Windows runs the per-profile install check only | CI matrix extension |
| `git` and `npm` delivery for `/profile` and for the update path against the real public repository | No release tag exists yet, and local mode is what the suites can exercise | The first release, then a run of `/update` from an install of it |
| pi 0.99.x | It was run once against the whole suite; it is advisory in CI, not supported | Review when pi 0.99 is adopted |

## Delegation and recovery

- **A child that fills its context window** is now told why (compaction off, a failed recovery,
  clamped output) and is not retried in a loop, but `subagent`'s failure hints do not yet mention
  overflow or compaction outcomes, so the parent sees the child's own message rather than a
  kit-authored hint.
- **`trigger-compact`'s mid-run resume** sends a visible user message and has been tested only
  with fakes. It never runs inside child sessions.
- **Effort budgets are accounting, not enforcement.** A hostile process owned by the same user can
  edit the ledger. Enforcing tiers at the operating-system level would need a supervisor outside
  the session.

## Approvals and the firewall

- **It is a guard rail, not a sandbox.** Containing what an allowed tool can reach needs an
  operating-system or container boundary (the autonomous runner provides one).
- **Low-tier actions run unasked in every mode**, including reads by tools whose name says they only
  read, and plain network GETs. Tightening this would prompt on every MCP `get_*`.
- **Package-manager and opaque-tool network use cannot be attributed to a host** in unattended
  runs; the container network is the stop.
- **`secret-guard` is opt-in.** The firewall already classifies credential files; whether the
  stricter pattern layer should be default needs data on its false-positive rate.
- **Companion tools that add their own shell or edit tools** (for example `pi-lean-ctx`) are seen
  only as unknown tools. Teaching the firewall the names of specific companions would make them
  first-class, and would need each one reviewed.
- **Unattended mode trusts the supervisor's claim** that its boundary exists. A forged contract
  elsewhere on disk is possible through paths that spawn pi without a shell.

## Profiles and compaction

- **A profile switch cannot undo** package payloads that `pi install` already fetched, a
  concurrent write to pi's settings, or a hard kill of pi part-way through. Rollback restores the
  settings files it snapshotted. The verifier may also roll back a good switch where the kit's
  entry cannot be identified (symlinked or unusual npm layouts); git and npm delivery of `/profile`
  are less exercised than local mode.
- **`lite` and small windows.** pi's default compaction reserve (16384 tokens) on a 32k window makes
  pi compact almost every turn; `/compaction status` now warns, but the `lite` profile does not yet
  carry its own `compaction` settings.
- **`autonomous` and `long-horizon`** load nearly the same set; the difference is the autonomous run
  tooling ([Autonomous runs](autonomy.md)).

## Web console

- Two version constants still read `0.1.0` (`routes.js`, `configinfo.js`); the session panel shows an
  unknown context percentage as 0%.
- The login link is passed to `xdg-open` as an argument, and the token file is readable by the agent
  the console drives (both are documented in [Web console](web-console.md)).

## Dependencies

Candidates that were evaluated and deliberately not adopted for the beta (`pi-lens` 4.x,
`pi-readseek` 0.10.x, `pi-mcp-adapter` 3.x, `pi-subagents`, TypeScript 7) are recorded in
[Supply chain](supply-chain.md) with their reasons. Revisit each with its own review.

## Quality of long-running work

- **Long-context reliability in planning and assessment.** Plan quality can degrade silently in very
  long sessions. Open question: which of the sieve, the goal file and the task graph carries the
  load, and how to measure it.
- **Skill disclosure and use.** How often skills are actually loaded when relevant, and whether the
  routing hints help or duplicate machinery, has not been measured.
- **Injection review.** A written review of untrusted-content handling across context contributions,
  tool results and memory recall (an injection inventory with a test per path) is still to be done.
