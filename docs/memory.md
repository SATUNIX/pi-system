# Memory vault

`memory-vault` gives pi durable memory in an **Obsidian-compatible vault**. The default is
`~/.pi/vault`; open that folder as a vault in Obsidian.

```
MEMORY.md                               index of every memory (regenerated)
Memory/<slug>.md                        global memories: apply in every project
Projects/<project>/<project>.md         project hub: memories + recent recaps
Projects/<project>/Memory/<slug>.md     project memories
Projects/<project>/Recaps/<date>.md     automatic per-turn recaps
Projects/<project>/Workflows/<run>/     workflow runs with `vault: true`
.pi-index/                              search index, lock, errors.log (hidden from Obsidian)
.trash/                                 forgotten notes (recoverable)
```

`<project>` is the git root's directory name, so every subdirectory of a repository shares
one project.

## Two kinds of memory

**Automatic: recaps.** After each substantive turn (one with tool calls, or a long answer), a
small model writes a recap: a title, what was done, the next step, files touched, and
decisions. It is appended to `Projects/<project>/Recaps/<date>.md`. Decisions, preferences
and gotchas it flags are promoted to memory notes, deduplicated. Trivial turns and subagent
children are skipped. The first prompt of every new session gets the last three recaps, so
pi knows where you left off.

**On request: memory notes.** When you say "remember …", the agent uses the `memory` skill
and `memory_save`. One note per memory, with frontmatter (`type: fact | decision | preference
| gotcha | reference`, `scope`, `tags`, dates, `source`). Saving something with the same or a
near-identical title updates the existing note instead of copying it.

## Recall

Memories are recalled into a **hidden message** before your prompt, never into the system
prompt (that would break prompt caching). Recall is scoped to the current project plus
global memories. It is gated by relevance (BM25 with stopwords and stemming, a minimum score,
and two matching terms for multi-word prompts). Each memory is injected at most once per
session.

## Commands and tools

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `/remember <text>` | Save directly (`/remember global: …` for every project) |
| `/memory` | Status: vault path, counts, settings |
| `/memory recent` | Latest recaps for this project |
| `/memory search <q>` · `/memory forget <id>` · `/memory migrate` | Search, forget (to `.trash`), import memory-local |
| `memory_save`, `memory_search`, `memory_forget` | The agent's tools |

## Settings

`~/.pi/agent/pi-kit/memory.json` (environment variables override it):

```json
{
  "vault": "~/.pi/vault",
  "recaps": true,
  "recapModel": "openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash",
  "autoPromote": true,
  "recallLimit": 3,
  "minScore": 1.5
}
```

The matching variables are `PI_KIT_VAULT`, `PI_KIT_RECAPS`, `PI_KIT_RECAP_MODEL`,
`PI_KIT_MEMORY_AUTOPROMOTE`, `PI_KIT_MEMORY_RECALL_LIMIT` and `PI_KIT_MEMORY_MIN_SCORE`.
`recapModel` should be a cheap, fast model. The default is the session's model.

Secrets (tokens, keys, `password=`-style values) are redacted before anything is written.
`/save --project <p>` also writes into the vault's project folder when the vault exists.

The older `memory-local` store (`~/.pi/agent/memory-local/memories.json`) is imported
automatically once.
