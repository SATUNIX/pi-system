# Code Compact

Summarize coding task state for continuation.

First read compact durable state through `pi_system_governance.state_summary` with `max_items` no higher than 5. Do not dump raw logs or full diffs.

Preserve:

- Objective and non-goals
- Current plan
- Files read and why
- Files changed
- Commands run and outcomes
- Current failure or blocker
- Verification status
- Unresolved risks
- Exact next action

Exclude secrets and sensitive data.

Return this stable block:

```text

  non_goals:
  active_step:
  files_read:
  files_changed:
  commands_run:
  validation:
  blocker:
