# Authz and IDOR Testing

Prove an access-control gap with the least intrusive evidence, using accounts you're
authorized to use — never real user data.

## When to use
- Testing authorization, privilege boundaries, or insecure direct object references (IDOR)
  on an in-scope, authorized target.

## Preconditions
- Scope + ROE loaded and the action approved (`scope-roe-governance`,
  `action-card-builder`).
- Approved **test accounts / fixtures** at each relevant privilege level.

## Procedure
1. **Establish the baseline.** Confirm what each test account is *allowed* to access.
2. **Paired comparison.** For each candidate object/endpoint, compare an **allowed** vs a
   **denied** identity performing the same request. A gap = the denied identity succeeds.
3. **Minimal proof.** Demonstrate access with a single object / one record — enough to
   prove the control fails. Do **not** enumerate or extract data at volume.
4. **Vary the reference, not the volume.** Change the object id/role, not the request rate.
5. **Record** the paired requests/responses as evidence (IDs/hashes), the accounts used,
   and the exact limitation (what you did and deliberately did not do).

## Constraints
- Test accounts and approved fixtures only — never live user data.
- No bulk extraction, no data exfiltration beyond a single proof-of-concept.
- Stay within rate limits and time windows in the ROE.

## Anti-patterns
- Scraping records to "show impact" — one object proves the gap.
- Testing with production user identities or real PII.
- Treating a discovered object as in-scope automatically.

## Done
The gap is shown by a clean allowed/denied pair with PoC-only data, evidence is recorded,
and limitations are stated. Promote via `hypothesis-lifecycle` → `finding-writing`.
