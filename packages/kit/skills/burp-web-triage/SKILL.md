# Burp Web Triage

Use Burp MCP as an evidence source, not as the workflow authority.

- Read history and sitemap only when classified as read-only.
- Normalize requests and responses into generic evidence records.
- Identify endpoints, auth states, parameters, and candidate vulnerability classes.
- Do not replay or modify requests without an approved action card.
