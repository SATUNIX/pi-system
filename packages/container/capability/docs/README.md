# pi-system — Capability Docs

Deployable pi coding agent with governed kit profiles installed from `pi-system`.

Use `capability/compose/compose.yaml` as the canonical Pi System compose entrypoint. The root `docker-compose.yml` is a compatibility entrypoint and must stay behaviorally equivalent except for build context relativity.

Environment defaults live in `capability/env/defaults.env`; Pi System overlays may override non-secret values such as `APP_PORT`, `PI_AGENT_DATA_ROOT`, `PI_AGENT_IMAGE`, and `PI_KIT_PROFILE`. Runtime state is stored below `/srv/data/pi-system`.

Rollback: redeploy the previous image tag or environment overlay. Runtime state lives in the data root, not in the container.
