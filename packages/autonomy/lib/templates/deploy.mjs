// tag or digest from the contract's allowlist, hardened like every other container, on the run's
// internal network only) and acceptance may include service health checks. Workers reach the
// services by name. Deploying to anything outside the zone is promotion, which is separate and
// needs a pre-authorised destination or an operator command; a worker never does it.
