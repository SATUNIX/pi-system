// Template interface (lib/engine.mjs calls these; self-improve adds runStep/onStepsDone):

//   defaults()            closed defaults merged under the user's contract
//   validate(c, {err, warn})  extra rules
//   seed(ctx)             once, before the first step: publish worker-visible files
//   stepPrompt(args)      the text a worker session gets
//   evaluate(ctx)         trusted judgement of an accepted head: { results, allRequiredPass }
//   promotion.targets(contract, cfg, sha)   what promotion would do
