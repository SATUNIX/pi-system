 * memory-vault — lexical relevance (BM25) with stopword filtering and a relevance floor.
 *
 * The previous recall scored a memory by counting raw query words found anywhere in it as
 * substrings, so "a", "the" and "is" matched nearly everything and every prompt injected the
 * three oldest memories. Here a query made only of stopwords matches nothing, and a result
 * must clear both a score floor and a matched-term floor before it is injected.
