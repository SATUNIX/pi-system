# Third-party extensions

Extensions under `third_party/` are adapted from upstream projects. Each directory contains a
`SOURCE.md` recording the origin and what was changed. The upstream licence text and credits are
in one place, the repository's `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` (generated from the `SOURCE.md` files by
`node packages/core/gen-notices.mjs`), rather than a copy in each directory. They are vendored
rather than referenced from npm because the kit carries local modifications that upstream does
not publish.

The vendored set composes with the first-party extensions in `../src/`. Profiles reference them
by name only, so the distinction is a provenance and maintenance concern, not an install-time one.

When updating a vendored extension, keep `SOURCE.md` accurate and re-run `npm run verify`.
